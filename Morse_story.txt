MORSE CODE IS DEFINED AS, EITHER OF TWO CODES CONSISTING OF VARIOUSLY SPACED DOTS AND DASHES OR LONG AND SHORT SOUNDS USED FOR TRANSMITTING MESSAGES BY AUDIBLE OR VISUAL SIGNALS. BASICALLY, MORSE CODE WAS A MEANS OF EARLY COMMUNICATION USING DOTS AND DASHES OR LONG AND SHORT SOUNDS THAT CORRELATED TO EACH LETTER OF THE LATIN ALPHABET. THESE MESSAGES WERE TYPICALLY SENT BY ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH OR BY LIGHT SIGNALS. SAMUEL FINLEY BREESE MORSE IS CREDITED WITH THE CREATION OR INVENTION OF MORSE CODE, WHO IT IS NAMED AFTER. HE WAS AN AMERICAN INVENTOR WHO WAS ALSO A WELL KNOWN PAINTER. HE WAS BORN ON APRIL 27, 1791 IN CHARLESTOWN. HE GRADUATED FROM YALE IN 1810 AND BEGAN HIS CAREER AS A PAINTER. SAMUEL MORSE HELPED FOUND THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF DESIGN BEFORE HE PURSUED HIS PASSION OF INVENTION. MORSE CODE WAS USED TO SEND MESSAGES OVER LONG DISTANCES. MORSE CODE MESSAGES CAN BE SENT USING LIGHT OR BY PULSES. IN SAMUEL MORSE'S TIME, THE MOST COMMON WAY TO SEND A PULSE MESSAGE WAS VIA A TELEGRAPH. A TELEGRAPH, ALSO KNOWN AS A STRAIGHT KEY, SENDS PULSES IN THE FORM OF ELECTRICAL CURRENT BASED ON THE MESSAGE THAT WAS "TAPPED OUT" USING THE TELEGRAPH KEY. TELEGRAPH OPERATORS WOULD THEN KEY MESSAGES USING A SERIES OF CLICKS BASED ON THE SPELLING OF THE WORDS OF THE MESSAGES. AN OPERATOR ON THE RECEIVING END WOULD HEAR THE CLICKS AND TRANSLATE THEM BACK INTO WORDS. WITH MORSE CODE, EACH LETTER OF THE ALPHABET WAS TRANSLATED INTO SHORT AND LONG SIGNALS, ALSO KNOWN AS DOTS AND DASHES. THE PULSE LENGTH OF A DASH IS EQUAL TO THE PULSE LENGTH OF THREE DOTS. EVENTUALLY, WHEN MORSE CODE WAS ADAPTED TO RADIO, THE DOTS AND DASHES BEGAN BEING REFERRED TO AS "DITS" AND "DAHS" BASED ON THE SOUND OF THE RADIO PULSES. MORSE CODE IS STILL WIDELY RECOGNIZED, EVEN IF IT IS NOT AS WIDELY USED AS IT ONCE WAS. MORSE CODE IS STILL POPULAR AMONG AMATEUR RADIO ENTHUSIASTS, ALTHOUGH PROFICIENCY IN MORSE CODE IS NO LONGER A REQUIREMENT TO OBTAIN YOUR AMATEUR RADIO LICENSE. MORSE CODE IS MOST PREVALENT IN AVIATION AND AERONAUTICAL FIELDS SINCE RADIO NAVIGATIONAL AIDS SUCH AS VOR'S AND NDB'S STILL IDENTIFY IN MORSE CODE. THE US NAVY AND COAST GUARD STILL USE SIGNAL LAMPS TO COMMUNICATE VIA MORSE CODE.
